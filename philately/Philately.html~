It is possible to be a philatelist without owning any stamps.For instance, the stamps being studied may be very rare, or reside only in museums.</p>  


<p style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;color :#0B2161;font-size:14.5px">The word "philately" is the English version of the French word <i>philatelie</i>, coined by Georges Herpin in 1864. He took the Greek root word phil or philo, meaning an attraction or affinity for something, and ateleia, meaning "exempt from duties and taxes" to form "philatelie".</p>

                    <br>	<p style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;color :#0B2161;font-size:14.5px">Philately is a delightful hobby that sharpens and satisfies one's aesthetic tastes. While expanding knowledge of and interaction with the world one gets to know interesting details of politics, history, prominent personalities, national and international events, geography, flora and fauna, agriculture, science, monuments, soldiers, warriors, scientists, arms and ammunition, modes of transport etc. This process of learning becomes more delightful through visuals and brief write-ups. In addition, philately cultivates a meticulous and focused attention to detail. It also helps in making friends across boundaries and age-barriers.</p>

                    	<p style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;color :#0B2161;font-size:14.5px">The Indian Philatelic history began with the introduction of paper postage in India in 1852. Before that copper tokens were introduced for payment of postage in 1774. Their use was, however, not found to be very convenient and need was felt for some other token of pre-payment. With the success of Penny Postage in England, Sir Bartel Frere, the Commissioner of Sind introduced paper stamps for his province in 1852. These stamps, known as Scinde Dawk, were round in shape and were issued in three variations : embossed on white paper without colour, on white paper in blue and on vermilion wafers. They were withdrawn in October, 1854 on the introduction of the regular India Postage Stamps though their use continued for quite some time.</p> 
                        
<p style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;color :#0B2161;font-size:14.5px">In 1854, it was decided to issue stamps for the British India and in the interest of the economy, to have them printed them in India. The first design for the India Postage stamps was attempted by Col. Forbes of Calcutta Mint showing the 'Lion and the Palm tree'. It was a bold and imaginative design but somehow it could never be used. The next stamps to be designed and printed in 1854, by the Surveyor General's Office were blue lithographed half anna stamps showing a youthful profile of Queen Victoria.</p>

<p style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;color :#0B2161;font-size:14.5px">While the first India Postage Stamps issued in 1854 bore the inscription 'India Postage', the inscription was changed in the same year to 'East India Postage'. This was changed from 1882 to 'India Postage' and continued till 1962. From November, 1962, a new caption 'INDIA' was introduced replacing the 'India Postage', though three stamps issued in December, 1962/January 1963 carried the earlier inscription.
</p> 


<p style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;color :#0B2161;font-size:14.5px">From the beginning of British Imperialist Rule, when the Queen Victoria stamps were issued in 1854, a portrait of British Monarch had figured in Indian Stamp Designs. This came to an end with India gaining independence on 15th August, 1947. The first independence stamps, issued in 1947, were three in number. They depicted the Ashoka Pillar, (National Emblem of India) the Indian National Flag and an Aircraft. Since then India has issued more than 3000 Stamps.
