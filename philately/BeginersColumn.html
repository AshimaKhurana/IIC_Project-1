Stamps have been issued from postal services from all over the world since 1840. Every subject you can imagine has been depicted on colorful stamps: Animals, sports, maps, cars, ships, movie stars,etc. No matter what your interest, there are stamps that will complement that interest. Stamp collecting is anything you want it to be.</p>

<p style="font-family:Vivaldi;color:black;font-size:30px">Why collect stamps?</p>
<div class="prod_box">

<p style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;color :#0B2161;font-size:14.5px">Stamp collecting is fun. It is a hobby that both young and old can do and enjoy. The stamp hobby can be enjoyed on any budget – or no budget at all. Collecting stamps keeps your mind active and inquisitive, increases your knowledge of places and events, relieves the stress of the day, and offers social opportunities.</p>

                    	<p style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;color :#0B2161;font-size:14.5px">Starting a stamp collection is simple to do. When first starting a stamp collection, collectors can save stamps from packages, postcards, and letters. Collectors could ask friends and family to save mail for them. Local businesses are also great places to get stamps. Places like stores, banks, and travel agencies may also save envelopes for collectors. Some collectors even start their collection by choosing one or two of their favorite subjects such as history, art, transportation, science, sports, or animals which is called topical collecting.<br><br><br> The following <i>tips</i> &nbsp;are a good way for collectors to start their stamp collection as well:</p> 
                        
 
               

<ul>

<li style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;color :#0B2161;font-size:14.5px">Buy new stamps from the post office to start a collection.</li>

<li style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;color :#0B2161;font-size:14.5px">Cut used stamps from old mail, packages, or letters. However, sometimes the entire envelope is more valuable than the stamp alone due to its unique postmark date. </li>

<li style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;color :#0B2161;font-size:14.5px">Have friends and family save their old stamps and envelopes. </li>

<li style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;color :#0B2161;font-size:14.5px">Buy stamps from dealers. Dealers are usually listed in the classifieds of the newspaper and offer stacks of stamps at a time. </li>

<li style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;color :#0B2161;font-size:14.5px">Order stamps can be ordered from websites or mail. In these cases a dealer can either send an assortment of stamps for collectors to choose from or a dealer can find specific stamps in his stock to send. </li>

<li style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;color :#0B2161;font-size:14.5px">Place a bid at a stamp auction.</li>

<li style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;color :#0B2161;font-size:14.5px">Trade with other collectors at stamp traders shows, clubs, or auctions. </li>

<p style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;color :#0B2161;font-size:14.5px">
Stamp dealers and collectors put stamps into categories based on their condition. A stamp that is in mint condition has been unused and is in the same condition as it was when purchased from the postal service. A used stamp, on the other hand, is one that has been cancelled.
<br></p>


<p style="font-family:Vivaldi;color:black;font-size:22px">
Evaluate the Front of the Stamp<br></p>


<p style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;color :#0B2161;font-size:14.5px">
To begin evaluating the condition of a stamp, the collector will need to first look at the front of the stamp. If a stamp is torn, it is not considered to be "collectible.Stamps that are perfectly centered are good condition, but those that are less than somewhat marred would be graded poor or fair.A stamp that has a light cancellation is more valuable than one that has heavy marks on it. 
</p>


<p style="font-family:Vivaldi;color:black;font-size:22px">
Examine the Back of the Stamp<br></p>


<p style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;color :#0B2161;font-size:14.5px">
The back of a stamp will be able to tell a collector whether a stamp has been treated carelessly. The collector should examine the back of the stamp for even distribution of the gum as well as the perforations. Knowing how to examine a stamp will help collectors to purchase stamps that are worth being in their collection.

Stamp collecting is easier and more fun when you have the right tools to help you organize, identify, and handle your stamps.<br><br><br>

<b>Storage</b> - Stamps can be stored in something as simple as a shoe box, but placing stamps in an album allows you to display your collection. You can buy an album or make your own.<br><br>

<b>Tongs</b> - Tongs look like tweezers, but have a smooth gripping surface designed to handle stamps. Using tongs keeps the oil and dirt from your fingers from damaging the stamps.<br><br>

<b>Magnifying Glass</b> - A magnifying glass is a great tool to help see the details of your stamps. Some stamps appear to be alike, but with close inspection you will see small differences that can help to identify a rare stamp.<br><br>

<b>Perforation Gauge</b> - Another tool to help find differences in stamps. The “perf” gauge is a scale used to measure the perforations or ridges along the outside edges of stamps.<br>

The first place that collectors can buy stamps for their collection is from the <i> Philatelic Bureau or Philatelic Counter </i>. Collectors can get stamps off of envelopes, packages, and postcards as well as ask friends and family for their used stamps. Classified ads in philatelic newspapers and magazines have listings of stamps as well. Collectors can use philatelic resources to increase their knowledge of stamp collecting. With various resources, stamp collectors can find local stamp trading clubs or shows.
